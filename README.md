# Parallel-Ball-Tree-Algorithm

The Ball Algorithm is used in the process of finding the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) of a given point in an n dimensional space. 
This repository was created for the final project for the Parallel and Distributed Computing course.
Three version were developed:
1 - OpenMP using shared-memory; \:
2 - MPI using distributed-memory; \:
3 - OpenMP and MPI using both shared-memory and distributed-memory. \:
