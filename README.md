# Parallel-Ball-Tree-Algorithm

This is the final project for the course "Parallel and Distributed Computing". This course is a Computer Science masters course in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico - Universidade de Lisboa.

The Ball Algorithm is used in the process of finding the k-nearest neighbors (kNN) of a given point in an n dimensional space. 

Three versions were developed: <br />
1 - OpenMP using shared-memory; <br />
2 - MPI using distributed-memory; <br />
3 - OpenMP and MPI using both shared-memory and distributed-memory. <br />
